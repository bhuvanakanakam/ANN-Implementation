As part of the course - Deep learning in mahindra university, during my senior yeat of college. I built the ann using scratch - no libraries.

Built an ANN in Python (no DL libraries) for y = sin(x) and Combined Cycle Power Plant regression; implemented vectorized backpropagation, mini-batch gradient descent, momentum, L2 regularization, multiple activations, and Adam optimizer; evaluated with MAPE.
